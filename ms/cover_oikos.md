To whom it may concern,

We are submitting our manuscript, ”Bridging the gap between theory and data: the Red Queen Hypothesis for sex”, for consideration for publication in Oikos. 

The Red Queen Hypothesis predicts that sexual reproduction can be maintained in the host population by producing genetically diverse offspring that are resistant to infection. While theoretical models have been widely used to study conditions under which this process can maintain sexual reproduction, few models try to make statistical connections between theoretical models and empirical data.

Our study asks how well a simple eco-evolutionary model can explain the observed prevalence of sexual reproduction in freshwater snails. Building on field studies of multiple snail-trematode systems, we estimate parameters of a simple but biologically plausible model. We use estimated parameters to compare the predicted relationship between the prevalence of infection and the frequency of sexual hosts with the observed relationships; we further quantify the statistical power of observing a significant correlation between these two quantities.

Our study contributes to the field by attempting a more direct connection between mechanistic dynamical models and field data, exploring what inferences can be made from data from typical studies. In addition, situations where our models have difficulty fitting the observed data (e.g. when infection rates are low) suggest new avenues for empirical and theoretical investigation.

Sincerely,
